# Verdant City
A four-month-long project from Aalborg University Copenhagen.
We created an educational computer game, aiming to raise awareness to the UN goal: 'Sustainable and green energy'.
The game features the implementaiton of several survival game mechanics (such as resource gathering, crafting system, objectives etc.) and interactive sound and music.
